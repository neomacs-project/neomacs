<h1 operator="">Markers</h1><p>A marker maintains a position in the buffer, which stays valid across arbitary editing operations.</p><h2>Marker advance types</h2><p>When an insertion happens at a marker, the marker may get pushed after the inserted contents (it <i>advances</i>), or stay before the inserted contents (it does not advance). This property can be queried and set using:</p><dl><dt class="comma-expr" operator=""><div class="list" operator=""><span class="symbol" operator="">fundoc</span><span class="symbol">'advance-p</span></div></span></dt></dl>
